# React Contact Form

React Contact Form is an application that was built to serve as a template to those who want to create a contact form in react without any back-end code.

### How it works

When a user naviagtes to the page, they are brought to a basic contact form that was built with `Bootstrap`. Input field data, form validation, and reset functionality is handled by `react-hook-form`. Once a user submits a valid form, `EmailJS` is used to send out an email of the completed contact form.
